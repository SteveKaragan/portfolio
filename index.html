        <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer, and I live in New York City.<p>

        <p>My professional background is broad and as varied as my interests.  I have domain expertise in:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Finance</li>
          <li>Higher Education</li>

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>After conducting a review of my career thus far, I realized that I had most enjoyed periods of change and improvement--and, you guessed it, that always involved technology!  I developed several desktop solutions for employers, and was a member of several software implementations in the finance space.</p>
          <p>I've enrolled at Bloc to become a software engineer, and participate in the information revolution of our times. I am very open to networking, collaborating, and career opportunities, and I enjoy hearing how other developers have navigated their careers. My favorite activity is experiencing different cultures, whether that is exploring New York's diversity or foreign travel:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Brazil</li>
            <li>Colombia</li>
            <li>Greece</li>
            <li>Italy</li>
            <li>France</li>
          </ul>
